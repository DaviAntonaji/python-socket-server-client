##### 👨🏻‍💻 About the project
###### Hi, this project is a socket server and socket client application in python. The server runs on a customizable port (5555 by default), where the client connects and can send messages or wait for messages from the socket, as they have a constantly active connection

------------
##### Installation

- Python installation is required (Yes, really, you're not looking for a Python Socket without having python installed, are you?)

- First install the dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- To run the 2 applications use 2 terminals executing each command in a terminal
```
python3 server.py

python3 client.py
```
